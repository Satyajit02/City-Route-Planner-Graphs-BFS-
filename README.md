# City Route Planner (Graphs – BFS)

A Python-based navigation tool that finds the shortest path between cities using the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm.

## Features
* **Graph Representation:** Uses an Adjacency List for memory efficiency.
* **Shortest Path:** Guarantees the shortest route in an unweighted graph.
* **Easy to Expand:** Add more cities and routes dynamically.

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.x
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python CityRoutePlanner(Graphs – BFS).py
